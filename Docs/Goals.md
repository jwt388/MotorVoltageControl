# Goals

## Avoid Reinventing the Wheel

This template is meant as a way to remember things. If we code something new or learned something about coding something old, we can clean it up, try to make it more generic and add it to the template.

## Use Best Practices

In the past when we need to use a device or class from WPI that we haven't used before, we would look at the WPI example and template projects. The problem with that is that those projects are designed to demonstrate specific things and are therefore as simple as possible to make the principles clear. Also, sometimes they have bugs, especially if they are new. We want a set of files that we can use as an example for our students that incorporate *all* of our best practices.

## Ease of Use

To work together as a team and collaborate with one another, we have to have processes, but the more details that need to be remembered, the more likely someone will forget a step, or forget how to do it. To that end, we try to make as much of the process as possible automatic and baked into the system. Automatic is better than pushing a button. Pushing a button is better than remembering to run a command from the VSCode pallette. Running from the pallette is better than running a command in a terminal. And running a command in a terminal is better than running a command with a lot of arbitrary flags. On the same token, using extensions to enforce coding style means that the students get a reminder and an explanation in real time. Same with static code analysis. The more things are taken care of automatically, the less we have to teach and the more time we can spend on the important topics.
